# Image_Classification_with_CNN
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of 10 categories. The workflow includes data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, and evaluation. This notebook is ideal for understanding image classification tasks using deep learning techniques.
